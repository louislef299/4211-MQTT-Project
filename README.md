# 4211-MQTT-Project

In order to successfully run the project, you type

```bash
make server
```

then type

```bash
make client
```

then, on one terminal, type

```bash
./start_server
```

and on another type

```bash
./start_client
```

This is how to start the code. Within the client program, by typing 'help', a list of command will appear and you will be able to publish, list topics, and subscribe to the main server. Enjoy!
