# 4211-MQTT-Project

In order to successfully run the project, you type

'''make server'''

then type

'''make client'''

then, on one terminal, type

'''./start_server'''

and on another type

'''./start_client'''

This is how to start the code. Within the client program, by typing 'help', a list of command will appear and you will be able to publish, list topics, and subscribe to the main server. Enjoy!
